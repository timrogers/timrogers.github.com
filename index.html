        <h2>Hi, I'm Tim Rogers.</h2>

<p>I'm a 19 year old developer, all-round geek and coffee addict from London, UK. At the moment I'm working for <a href="https://gocardless.com">GoCardless</a> (@GoCardless), a UK payments startup where we're working hard to fix
  online payments forever.</p>
  
  <p>I make bits and bobs every now and then, usually web-based projects working with Ruby and Javascript. I love
    writing code, especially if I can release it and (hopefully) benefit others.</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>

<h3>Lloyds TSB screen scraper</h3>

<p>I bank with Lloyds TSB - I have my current account and credit card with them. Like most online banking services though, they're not to up-to-date on APIs and the like. After looking around online, I found that there were a couple of scripts that people had built, but I didn't have much luck with them myself. So I decided to build my own screen scraper.</p>

<p>Once again using Ruby with Mechanize, much like my UCAS one (below), I've built a script which can login to Lloyds TSB with your username, password and memorable word. There were some particularly interesting challenges, especially with the memorable word part, since the login pages ask for particular characters which change each time.</p>

<p>When run, the script returns a list of your accounts and the recent transactions for them. If you want to give it a go, you can download the script <a href="https://github.com/timrogers/lloydstsb">here</a>.</p>

<h3>UCAS screen scraper</h3>

<p>In the UK, we make university applications via a system called UCAS. It has no APIs and generally the whole experience
  with staying up to date with your application isn't too great. So I decided to build a solution comprised of two parts:
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/timrogers/ucas">ucas</a></strong>, a Ruby script to be run periodically (every
      minute, for me!) which screen scrapes from the UCAS Track system using Mechanize and saves to a Redis database, providing
      SMS and email notifications.</li>
      <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/timrogers/ucas-frontend">ucas-frontend</a></strong>, a Sinatra app which provides
        a pretty interface to the Redis backend meaning that <em>anyone</em> can see my application status. It's running live at
        <a href="http://ucas.timrog.net">http://ucas.timrog.net</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>All of the code is reusable for the project, and I'd love to see people contribute. For a bit more information on how
        things work, check out my blog post <a href="http://www.tim-rogers.co.uk/posts/ucas-universities-and-open-data">
          UCAS, universities and open data</a>.</p>

<h3>Unistats API library <em>(for Ruby)</em></h3>

<p>The UK government organisation <a href="http://hefce.ac.uk">Higher Education Funding Council for England</a> provides a site
  called <a href="http://www.unistats.com">Unistats</a> with lots of information about university courses in the UK. This even has
  a free-to-use API.</p>
  
  <p> The organisation of the data is a bit odd, but I nonetheless decided to build an API library for my own use
  - you can find the details <a href="https://github.com/timrogers/unistats">here</a>, and install it really quickly by running
  <code>gem install unistats</code>.</p>
  
  <h3>Impatient <em>(a Ruby gem)</em></h3>
  
  <p>I run quite a few projects on Heroku, and I get tired of the wait after deploy for them to be ready to go. It's really
    short, but I get annoyed every time I have to run <code>heroku ps</code> after deploying whilst I wait to check that
    everything has worked.</p>
    
    <p>With my Ruby gem "impatient", this is no longer necessary. Basically, it lets you deploy your Heroku project simply by
      running <code>imp</code> - this runs the <code>git push heroku master</code> command and then repeatedly executes <code>
        heroku ps</code> until the app is up and ready to go. It'll then automatically open the site for you. Neat, huh?</p>
        
        <p>You can download the source of this from my <a href="https://github.com/timrogers/impatient">GitHub repository</a>,
          or simply run <code>gem install impatient</code>.</p>
          
<h3>Windows Phone application samples</h3>

<p>As part of a number of competitions that Microsoft UK ran early in 2012 with prizes like Xbox 360s and Windows Phones, I built
  some really simple (but pretty cool!) Windows Phone apps and open sourced them. People are welcome to do as they please with these,
  and they serve as a great starting point for your own application, whether there's a competition to be won or not.</p>
  
  <p>There are two sample apps available:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/timrogers/joker-soundboard-wp7">joker-soundboard-wp7</a></strong>, a soundboard featuring
      sounds from The Joker in awesome film The Dark Knight. You can adapt this to make any soundboard you wish, and it even includes
      the ability to set the sounds as a ringtone. This has been <em>fairly</em> commercially successful, as it happens.</li>
      <li>strong><a href="https://github.com/timrogers/business-card-wp7">business-card-wp7</a></strong>, is a really simple application
        which basically acts a business card for your phone, including an <em>oh-so-pointless</em> QR code (but everyone loves them...).
        It's basically a picture and contact details. It's a bit pointless, but it still serves as an interesting demo.</li>
      </ul>
